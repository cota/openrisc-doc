OpenRISC
========

OpenRISC is an Open Source CPU that brings to the world of hardware all the
same advantages that Open Source software has known for so long.  The OpenRISC
project is community-driven with most of the action at http://opencores.org/openrisc

These pages primarily target the Linux on OpenRISC use-case and aim to help
you get up to speed as quickly as possible.  Feedback on these pages and
questions not answered here can be directed to jonas@southpole.se or vented on
#opencores at freenode.  We look forward to your becoming a part of the
larger OpenRISC family!

News

Linux 2.6.38 is almost here.  Here's what's new for OpenRISC Linux in 2.6.38.

* Completely reworked syscall handling.  Unfortunately this breaks ABI, but
  this needed to be done before making the push for inclusion upstream.  This
  makes syscalls much more lightweight and allows GCC to generate better code
  around them.  For certain workloads, this should result in a measureable
  performance improvement.
+
NOTE: This is an ABI break and will require an updated uClibc, too.

* Device tree blob (DTB) is now selectable in config file.  This means that
  you don't have to mess with Makefiles anymore when using a different DTB.

* Added support for kernel modules.

* Indices into ptrace structure made equal to register number, for clarity.

* Offsets into ptrace structure prefixed by PT_ for clarity.

* Lots of bug fixes, header file cleanups, and general improvements.
